      <description>&lt;p&gt;Strava art (or GPS art) is running/cycling a route with the aim of creating a picture with the GPS recording of your activity. Looking to add some variety into my COVID-19 lock-down/isolation runs I have given this a go recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-2020&#34;&gt;Easter 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Easter I ran 18km in the shape of a rabbit. Some of the narrow London streets flanked by tall buildings make for some wobbly GPS readings, and there was one part where I had to scramble over some construction work to stay on track. But overall I was fairly happy with it as a first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;anzac-day-2020&#34;&gt;A.N.Z.A.C. Day 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This A.N.Z.A.C. day, the dawn service was cancelled due to the COVID-19 virus. With no flour to bake A.N.Z.A.C. biscuits, the only thing left to do was to run the shape of a giant kiwi around the streets of London. This one was a 21.5 km loop taking in the City, Regents Canal, and some of the parks in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the route I did come across two locked gates which impeded my progress. But I was able to navigate around them on the fly without affecting the overall route too much.&lt;/p&gt;
