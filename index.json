Workers learn some of the productive knowledge used by their employer while working on the job. When a worker moves to another firm, they are able to adapt some of this knowledge for use at the hiring firm. Firms endogenously control their exposure to new knowledge by choosing the intensity that they post vacancies in a search-and-matching labor market. It is shown that under a set of assumptions regarding the initial distribution of firm types and the vacancy posting cost function, the competitive equilibrium leads to a balanced growth path that has a constant growth rate and stationary distribution of firm size.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Through Hiring: Knowledge From New Workers as an Explanation of Endogenous Growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"f257f569cb65a3518e66516c7dfce2ee","permalink":"https://michaelkirker.net/code/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/code/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"Code","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"fd36605688ef45e10dc233c860158012","permalink":"https://michaelkirker.net/cv/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cv/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"CV","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://michaelkirker.net/research/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"Research","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Michael Kirker","Lynda Sanderson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1518652800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518652800,"objectID":"df04d42a8072ab35389d1464f0faa2d1","permalink":"https://michaelkirker.net/publication/prod-growth-hires/","publishdate":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/prod-growth-hires/","section":"publication","summary":"Using linked employer-employee data, productivity growth at a firm is related to the firm’s exposure to outside knowledge, proxied by the difference between the hiring firm’s productivity and the productivity of the new worker’s previous employer. The estimated relationship is compared to the predictions implied by both the knowledge spillover and worker quality channels. While not a causal relationship, the multi-factor productivity results are consistent with the predictions of a worker quality channel in which positive assortative matching between workers and firms acts as a signal of the unmeasured worker quality that will benefit the hiring firm. When firm productivity is measured in terms of labor productivity, support is also found for knowledge spillovers occurring from more to less productive firms through the labor mobility channel. Further investigation suggests that this knowledge spillover pertains to production technology knowledge, allowing the firm to operate at higher levels of capital intensity, and not multi-factor productivity knowledge, that would allow the firm to operate its current inputs more efficiently.","tags":[],"title":"Firm Productivity Growth and its Relationship to the Knowledge of New Worker","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["matlab"],"content":"","date":1513728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513728000,"objectID":"a70422963f8913aa26e3577d2ed71da4","permalink":"https://michaelkirker.net/project/time-varying-natural-rates/","publishdate":"2017-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/time-varying-natural-rates/","section":"project","summary":"Code for the model used in the paper \"Does natural rate variation matter?

The results show that core inflation in both countries is primarily driven by the nontradable factor.

However, many of these models rely on demeaned interest rate and inflation data. Thus, they implicitly impose the strict assumption that the natural rates of these series are constant. Using New Zealand data and a small open-economy new Keynesian model with time-varying parameters, we estimate the natural real rate of interest, inflation target, potential output, and neutral real exchange rate. We find that the model estimates of the natural real rate of interest and neutral exchange rate display noticeable time variation and considerable uncertainty, while the inflation target has been relatively stable over the sample period. We also compare the results of this model to a model with time-invariant natural rates. The comparison reveals the data prefers the fit of the timevarying model. It also shows that allowing the natural rates to vary over time has implications for the persistence parameters and impulse responses of the model.","tags":[],"title":"Does Natural Rate Variation Matter?
