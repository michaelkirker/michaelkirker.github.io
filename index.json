The estimated relationship between productivity growth and hiring is compared to the predictions implied by two different channels: worker quality and knowledge spillover. Although it is not possible to identify a causal relationship, the productivity of a worker’s previous employer is correlated with subsequent productivity growth at the hiring firm. The patterns of this correlation are consistent with both the worker quality and knowledge spillover channels operating simultaneously. Furthermore, if knowledge spillover is occurring, the results suggest the type of knowledge spilling over relates to technological knowledge allowing firms to become more capital intensive, rather than knowledge that improves the efficiency of utilising existing inputs.","tags":[],"title":"Firm Productivity Growth and the Knowledge of New Workers","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":[],"content":"The London Hash House Harriers (LH3) run weekly all over London.

Workers learn some of the productive knowledge used by their employer while working on the job. When a worker moves to another firm, they are able to adapt some of this knowledge for use at the hiring firm. Firms endogenously control their exposure to new knowledge by choosing the intensity that they post vacancies in a search-and-matching labor market. It is shown that under a set of assumptions regarding the initial distribution of firm types and the vacancy posting cost function, the competitive equilibrium leads to a balanced growth path that has a constant growth rate and stationary distribution of firm size.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Through Hiring: Knowledge From New Workers as an Explanation of Endogenous Growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"f257f569cb65a3518e66516c7dfce2ee","permalink":"https://michaelkirker.net/code/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/code/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"Code","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"fd36605688ef45e10dc233c860158012","permalink":"https://michaelkirker.net/cv/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cv/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"CV","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://michaelkirker.net/research/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"Research","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":[],"categories":["matlab"],"content":"","date":1513728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513728000,"objectID":"a70422963f8913aa26e3577d2ed71da4","permalink":"https://michaelkirker.net/project/time-varying-natural-rates/","publishdate":"2017-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/time-varying-natural-rates/","section":"project","summary":"Code for the model used in the paper \"Does natural rate variation matter?

However, many of these models rely on demeaned interest rate and inflation data. Thus, they implicitly impose the strict assumption that the natural rates of these series are constant. Using New Zealand data and a small open-economy new Keynesian model with time-varying parameters, we estimate the natural real rate of interest, inflation target, potential output, and neutral real exchange rate. We find that the model estimates of the natural real rate of interest and neutral exchange rate display noticeable time variation and considerable uncertainty, while the inflation target has been relatively stable over the sample period. We also compare the results of this model to a model with time-invariant natural rates. The comparison reveals the data prefers the fit of the timevarying model. It also shows that allowing the natural rates to vary over time has implications for the persistence parameters and impulse responses of the model.","tags":[],"title":"Does Natural Rate Variation Matter?
